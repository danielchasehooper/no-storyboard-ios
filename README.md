A bare bones project to illustrate how to make an iOS app that doesn't use a storyboard,nib or xib file. If you'd prefer to show an image instead of a color, use the `UIImageName` key in your plist file as described in [Apple's documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information-property-list/uilaunchscreen)

Tested on iOS 18.3.1
